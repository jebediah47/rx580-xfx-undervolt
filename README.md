# jeb47's undervolt script
### Only tested on XFX RX 580 8GB, never had any stability issues
### ⚠️ NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE ⚠️

## To install just make the `install.sh` executable and run as root:
```css
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
This will simply add the `undervolt` script to `/bin` and also create a systemd service for it to run on boot
